# tundraden
Analysis and visualization of correlated data from scratch. "tundraden" is an anagram of "redundant".

## Motivation

This package was made within a university project. The goal was to tackle regression issues when dealing with correlated data. One constraint was to have minimal library dependencies in order to fully understand the mathematics behind, which is why some functions or classes might seem like duplicates from widely used libraries.

## Example
See the `example.ipynb` notebook for example usage.
